Test task about figures.

It is necessary to describe the task using the principles of OOP.

The condition of the test task:
Given the figure objects of the following types: square, triangle, circle, trapezium.
Each shape can be drawn, get its area and color.
Also, the figures have unique methods, for example: return the radius, the length of the hypotenuse, the length of the side, etc.

We need to generate a random set of shapes, the number of objects in the set is also not known in advance.
After generating the array, you need to display the entire list of objects that we have, for example:
Figure: square, area: 25 square meters. units, side length: 5 units, color: blue
Figure: triangle, area: 12.5 square units, hypotenuse: 7.1 units, color: yellow
